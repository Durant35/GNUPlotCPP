GNUPlotCPP is a C++ library for interfacing with GNUPlot directly from C++ 
code. The main objective is to bring MatLab-like plotting capabilities into a 
C++ coding environment. The idea behind it is that, during research and 
development phases of programming, you may want to visualize some data that 
occurs somewhere inside your code. Or you may want to write some experimental 
code that deliberately produces test data for visualization. So, basically, 
GNUPlotCPP is a tool for experimentation, development and debugging of C++ 
code. It may also be useful for creating plots for inclusion into technical 
documentations of your algorithms and code.
